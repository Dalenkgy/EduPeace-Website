## EduPeace

Piece of Peace Productions is developing a new, advanced app that will educate you about gun violence and help increase the stability of peace and justice in the world.

Our goal
The world can experience a lot of improvements. There are 17 global goals, and we are starting by working toward goal # 16: Peace and Justice. We hope to provide an app that can educate many people about gun violence and help spread awareness about it.

Release
The app is available on the web in a phone simulator via appetize.io.

*Note: The appetize.io program can easily crash. The APK is a more stable option.

The APK and AIA (MIT App Inventor) files are available to download in Google Drive:

The app will only be able to be downloaded on Android devices.
